Economist working on macroeconomics and public finance.

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Zürich](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en.html). My research focuses on macroeconomics and public finance. I use theory and computational tools to identify new mechanisms and quantify their impact.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [Northwestern University](https://economics.northwestern.edu/) in 2024.
