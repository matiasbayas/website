title: Tariffs, Trade Deficits, and Liquidity Supply

abstract: |
  A simple model is used to study the effects of tariffs on the current account balance when a country runs permanent trade deficits. The model features a simple form of "exorbitant privilege" that allows a country to run a permanent and sustainable current account deficit. Unlike in models based on a traditional intertemporal approach, tariffs do not affect saving through their effects on the real interest rate, and do not dampen current account imbalances.
