abstract: "This chapter sheds some light on the prospects for the Ecuadorian economy in the aftermath of the Revolución Ciudadana and a permanent reduction in oil prices. Given that the economy’s progress is contingent on whether or not private sector investment can take over and replace the public sector as the main engine of the economy, I have focused on how fiscal policy can affect private investment decisions. So, this analysis relates to the importance of solving the implementation problem in order to ensure that the economy moves toward a period of growth and increasing living standards. Whether fiscal authorities manage to construct a credible and strategic fiscal policy will determine the economic outcomes to be realized in the future. Moreover, given that individual preferences may not be separable from government expenditures, the need to create a fiscal stabilization fund has been emphasized, as well as the importance of focusing adjustments on current rather than capital expenditures."
