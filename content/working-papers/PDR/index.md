title: "Optimal Public Debt with Redistribution (JMP, coming soon)"

url_pdf: ''

summary: This paper studies the interaction between public debt and redistribution when markets are incomplete and agents are heterogeneous. I consider a standard heterogeneous agent model where the government controls both the progressivity of the tax schedule and the level of public debt. I compute the optimal mix of debt and progressivity, comparing two different concepts of long-run optimality. In both the optimal steady state and the Ramsey steady state, planners that care about redistribution favor _lower_ levels of debt. This is due to a novel interest rate channel-- redistributive taxation reduces the need to self-insure and thus makes government borrowing more expensive. I back out the implied preferences for redistribution in advanced economies and argue that they are inconsistent with both Utilitarian and Rawlsian criteria.
