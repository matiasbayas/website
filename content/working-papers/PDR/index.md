title: "Optimal public debt with redistribution"

summary: This paper studies the interaction between public debt and redistribution when markets are incomplete and agents are heterogeneous. I consider a standard incomplete markets economy where the government controls both the progressivity of the tax schedule and the level of public debt. Agents are subject to uninsurable idiosyncratic income risk and smooth consumption by holding a risk-free asset, which I interpret as public debt. I compute the optimal mix of debt and progressivity, comparing three different optimality concepts that have been explored by the literature. I find that planners that care about redistribution favor _lower_ levels of debt due to a novel interest rate channel-- redistributive taxation reduces the need to self-insure and thus makes government borrowing more expensive. In addition, the two instruments can be substitutes or complements, depending on the planner's taste for redistribution. I back out the implied preferences for redistribution in the US and show that they are inconsistent with both Utilitarian and Rawlsian criteria.
