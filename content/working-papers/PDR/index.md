title: "Optimal public debt with redistribution (JMP, coming soon)"

summary: This paper studies the interaction between public debt and redistribution when markets are incomplete and agents are heterogeneous. I consider a standard heterogeneous agent model where the government controls both the progressivity of the tax schedule and the level of public debt. I compute the optimal mix of debt and progressivity, comparing three different optimality concepts that have been explored by the literature. I find that planners that care about redistribution favor _lower_ levels of debt due to a novel interest rate channel-- redistributive taxation reduces the need to self-insure and thus makes government borrowing more expensive.
